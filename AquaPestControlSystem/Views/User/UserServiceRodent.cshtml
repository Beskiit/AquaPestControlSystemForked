        <h2 class="mb-4 text-4xl font-semibold">Rodent Treatment</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Rodents, such as rats and mice, are not only unsightly but also pose serious health and safety risks when they invade homes and businesses. These pests are known for gnawing through walls, wiring, and other materials, potentially causing structural damage and even fire hazards due to exposed electrical wires. Their droppings and urine can contaminate food, surfaces, and air quality, leading to the spread of diseases such as Hantavirus, Salmonella, and Leptospirosis.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Rodents are highly adaptive creatures that can infiltrate a property through even the smallest openings, making it challenging to keep them out without proper measures. They reproduce rapidly, so a small infestation can quickly grow into a larger problem. In addition to damaging property, rodents can also bring fleas, ticks, and mites into the environment, further exacerbating health concerns.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Professional rodent treatment services focus on eliminating these pests and preventing their return. The process begins with a detailed inspection to identify entry points, nesting areas, and food sources. Treatment methods may include setting traps, using rodenticides, sealing entry points, and implementing exclusion techniques to block access. Pest control experts also provide recommendations for maintaining a rodent-free environment, such as proper sanitation and storage practices.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Preventative measures are essential to avoid recurring infestations. Regular inspections, along with proactive steps like sealing cracks and holes, storing food in sealed containers, and removing clutter that provides hiding spots, can significantly reduce the risk of rodent activity. Addressing infestations promptly ensures the safety and cleanliness of your home or business, protecting your property and the health of everyone within.
